# MCP Spring AI Example

This repository contains an example of building a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** using **Java** and **Spring AI**.  
The example demonstrates how to expose tools via MCP so that agents can communicate with them using the MCP protocol.

## Overview
This example uses Spring AI to simplify MCP server creation, allowing you to focus on defining your tools and business logic instead of protocol details.

Hereâ€™s an example structure for `mcp.json`:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spring-ai": {
      "command": "java -jar  <ABSOLUTE_PATH>/spring-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```
